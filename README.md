# morb modpack
Some modpack with a bunch of mods that we made for friends. Has tech and exploration and some other stuff in it I don't know do I look like I mod minecraft?????

Download the source code from releases (or clone the git repo) and then install the .jar files within "Clientside" to your Minecraft client, and the .jar files in "Serverside" to the server. Pretty self explanatory.
